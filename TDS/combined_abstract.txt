This paper proposes the development of a Global Trust Index (GTI) as a comprehensive benchmarking indicator to enhance sovereign and sub-sovereign credit assessments in the digital age. The GTI addresses critical limitations in current credit rating methodologies, which rely heavily on the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGIs) - annual perception-based metrics that the World Bank itself now advises against using for financial decisions due to their methodological limitations, time lags, and embedded biases. By leveraging the digital transformation of government services, the proposed index would integrate real-time, objective service delivery metrics with user experience data and digital trust dimensions, providing a more accurate, timely, and granular assessment of institutional quality than existing governance indicators. The GTI framework encompasses multiple dimensions including service access, responsiveness, and quality, whilst incorporating emerging considerations such as cybersecurity, data privacy, and AI governance capabilities as governments transition from basic web presence to intelligent, predictive service delivery. This standardised measurement system would not only improve the credibility of sovereign risk assessments and reduce borrowing costs for well-performing governments, but also incentivise public service improvements, support evidence-based policymaking, and create a powerful mechanism linking institutional trustworthiness directly to capital market confidence.
