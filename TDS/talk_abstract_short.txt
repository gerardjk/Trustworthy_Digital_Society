This talk introduces the Global Trust Index (GTI), a proposed system to revolutionise how credit rating agencies assess government creditworthiness. Current methodologies rely on the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators - outdated metrics that even the World Bank advises against using for financial decisions. The GTI would harness real-time data from digital government platforms, combining service delivery metrics with user feedback to create dynamic assessments of institutional quality. By tracking how governments deliver essential services whilst incorporating digital trust dimensions like cybersecurity and AI governance, this index provides capital markets with credible, timely sovereign risk indicators. The GTI could incentivise governments to enhance public services and accelerate digital transformation, directly linking institutional performance to borrowing costs.
